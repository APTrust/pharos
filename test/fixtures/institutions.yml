# These fixtures are used in integration tests with the
# APTrust Go services. They're not used for spec tests.
# Note that UUIDs must be valid version 4 UUIDs for
# any data shared with DPN. That means the third component
# must start with 4, and the fourth component must start
# start with 8, 9, a, or b. DPN integration tests will
# fail otherwise.
