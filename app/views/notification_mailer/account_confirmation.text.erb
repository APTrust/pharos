Hello <%= @subject.name %>,

Once a year we at APTrust send out emails to confirm everyone's account to ensure your user account is still active.
You will have two weeks to confirm your account on the <%= Rails.env.capitalize %> system before your account will be deactivated.
At that point, if you are still an active user, you will need to contact an administrator to reactivate your account.

  Please click the following link to confirm your account.
  <%= @confirmation_url %>

Please contact the APTrust team if you have any questions.
  eMail - help@aptrust.org
  Slack - http://bit.ly/aptrust-slack #aptrust_community

Thanks so much for being a part of the APTrust preservation community.
