Hey <%= @subject.name %>,

Welcome to Pharos, the APTrust web application.

You now have an account with a temporary password. You will be prompted to change this password the first time you log in to Pharos.
  Please choose a new password that is at least 10 characters long. If you are an institutional admin, you will also be required to setup two
  factor authentication. Even if you aren't required to use two factor authentication, we highly recommend it. It can be set up in your user profile.

Your temporary password is <%= @password %>.

Please contact the APTrust team if you have any questions.
